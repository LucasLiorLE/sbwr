# Slap Battles World Record
Slap battles world record retrieving website so you don't have to manually go on the spreadsheet. Might update more with other rules and stuff but yeah I only make stuff when I'm bored
Uses http://eu-ro-01.wisp.uno:9761/api/sbwr/get-records to retrieve stuff and yeah basically just copy and paste from my wordle code. 
Yes it is technically "static" but has backend support so if my backend goes down, the site won't work properly sorry! I might find a way to retrieve xlsx or =HYPERLINK elements without downloading it later (I don't want to use my google acc since that also requires a backend), and "why can't you just make a request to it?" it shows the text, not the link, so it won't work correctly.
